                Robert Downey Jr. kept food hidden all over the lab set, and apparently nobody could find where it was, so they just let him continue doing it. In the movie, that's his actual food he's offering, and when he was eating, it wasn't scripted, he was just hungry.

                There were very few times that everyone was in town at once, but on one night when they were, Chris Evans sent them all a text message reading "Assemble" (the tagline to the movie), prompting a night out on the town. Clark Gregg has stated that this is his favorite text message that he has ever received.

                    Steve Rogers: Thor, what's his play?
                    
                    Thor: He has an army, called the Chitauri. They're not of Asgard or any world known. He means to lead them against your people. They will win him the Earth. In return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.
                    
                    Steve Rogers: An army. From outer space.
                    
                    Bruce Banner: So he's building another portal. That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.
                    
                    Thor: Selvig?
                    
                    Bruce Banner: He's an astrophysicist.
                    
                    Thor: He's a friend.
                    
                    Natasha Romanoff: Loki has them under some kind of spell. Along with one of ours.
                    
                    Steve Rogers: I wanna know why Loki let us take him. He's not leading an army from here.
                    
                    Bruce Banner: I don't think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy's brain is a bag full of cats. You can smell crazy on him.
                    
                    Thor: Have a care how you speak! Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard and he is my brother!</p>
